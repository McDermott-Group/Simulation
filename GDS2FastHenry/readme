GDS2FastHenry python fasthenry script

Creates a FastHenry .inp file from a GDS file. Software is somewhat buggy and incomplete, so use at your own risk.

Requires python-gdsii-0.2.1 pacakge to be installed in your local python.

See run.py for example of how to use this script.

Functionally, this script is based on two classes:
1. ImportGDSII -- imports a GDS file and converts it into an internal representation, which is then piped to
2. FastHenryFile -- which converts that internal representation into a fastHenry .inp file

Use the function ImportGDSII.GDS2FH(filename, thick=0.1, comments='', skiplayers=[]) to do the actual conversion.

thick specifies the thickness of all metal layers (0.1 micron default)
comment will be printed as a comment at the top of the FastHenry file
skiplayers specifies what GDS layer numbers to ignore when processing the file

The GDS file should be in a specific format to ensure succesful conversion:
1. There should be a single top level cell with all of the geometry. 
2. Rectangles on GDS layer 0 will be assumed to be FastHenry ground planes
3. Wires on each GDS layer are converted to traces in FastHenry and joined together in the order wire vertices are drawn in the GDS file
   (i.e. draw each inductor on a separate GDS layer)
4. FastHenry input/output ports are placed at the start and end of each wire
