    "# Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to have a very good method of selecting resonator lengths such that we minimize the time it takes to fabricate suitable frequency-targeted qubit devices for readout with an amplifier. We must also ensure that these devices are spaced in frequency enough such that individual readout resonators are easily resolved in frequency and phase space for a given coupling rate $\\kappa$. \n",

    "# Method\n",
    "## Capacitance and Inductance of Bare CPW (no crossovers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the geometry alone, one is able to calculate the phase velocity of the CPW by finding the the capacitance per unit length. (See [Goppel](http://arxiv.org/pdf/0807.4094v1.pdf) and [Gupta](https://www.scribd.com/doc/112426565/Gupta-Et-Al-1996-Microstrip-Lines-and-Slotlines-2nd-Ed) (p. 382) for details.) The calculation to be done are\n",

    "\n",
    "We know that the resonance frequency of the cavity will be pulled by adding in extra capacitances (grounding straps, the coupling capacitance $C_{\\kappa}$, the qubit pocket, etc.) and inductances (say from coupling in inductively). The frequency that we specify in the function `calcQuarterWavelength()` below is the frequency we desire *after* taking these capacitances into account.\n",
